                    <p class="text">You may come off as tough and hard on the outside with your built and how you bring yourself but you are one of the most soft-hearted persons I know. Thank you for being the most caring and loving dad out there. We may have numerous banters and arguments but these do not compare for the love you have for ate and I. With each problem or heartbreak I face, you have always been there to pick up my broken pieces. It didn’t matter whether my problem was big or small or whether it was my fault to begin with or not. You were always there to fix me back up when I didn’t know how to fix myself. I will never forget the time I cried to you for weeks because of a break-up. You tried everything to comfort me and distract me from the pain I was feeling, but nothing worked to stop my breakdowns. I apologized to you because I knew my crying was getting tiresome for the people around me, but you told me that it was okay to cry to you. You told me it was your job as a parent to listen and just be there for me. In that moment, I realized that I was so lucky to have a dad like you. Not all parents care when their children cry over a breakup. Thank you, Pa, for your patience. You taught me that no matter the circumstances, I would always have you as my back-up and, of course, as my bestfriend. Though I don’t say it as often as I should, please do know that I am so grateful to have you as my dad and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love you Pa.</p>

                <div class="post-text">
                    <p class="text">You have been one of my role models ever since I can remember. Growing up, I’ve seen the things you do for us. All the times you went home an hour or so before sunrise and the times you cried to dad because of the stress your work gave you. I know how much your work stresses you out and how much you want to quit, but you still continue to persevere. And despite everything, you still try your utmost best to be there for ate and I. To still take on the role of being a mom to us. I idolize you for that. I know I don’t say this often, but thank you Ma. For everything you’ve done for us. I remember one time, I greeted you for your birthday. You replied with a short letter and an apology for being an absentee mom. Ma, we never complained with your absence because we know that what you’re doing is for us and we love you for that. I love you, Ma, for being the strongest woman I know.</p>

                <div class="post-text">
                    <p class="text">In the past, I always saw you as my nemesis. Someone I had to fight with to get our parents attention. A hindrance in getting the things I want. But as we grew older, little by little, we also grew closer. With life throwing at us problem after problem, we learned that these get easier to conquer when you have someone by your side. Through everything we’ve been through, I’m lucky to have you always as my sidekick. I’m lucky I have you to rant to when I don’t have anyone else. I’m lucky I have you as my sister. Thank you for never getting tired of hearing all my problems, complaints, and non-sense stories. You never fail to make me realize that the problems I face are only small compared to the life I have ahead of me. You make it seem like something not worth worrying about and I love you for that. I know I may not say this often (or at all actually) but I love you and I’m very thankful God gave me you as my sister.</p>
